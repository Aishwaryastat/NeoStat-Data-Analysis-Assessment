# NeoStat-Data-Analysis-Assessment

A. Overview
Dataset 2 is a list bank customers who have a credit card with the bank. It suggests whether a credit
card customer is performing good or bad for a bank. It contains 20 features including demographic,
socio-economic and transactional variables for 5050 customers who have an active credit card with
the bank.
Data description: The data contains a 'class' variable where bad=Customers who are not profitable
credit card holders for the bank and Good=Customers who are profitable credit card holders for the
bank. Customer_id is a unique serial number/identifier of each customer.
B. Questions -EDA in Python:
Python codes to be shared. Export final results of each question into a word document or
PowerPoint and share along with codes.
1) Examine each variable (except customer_id), summarize the finding and interpret
them.
2) Do you see any outlier in any of the 22 variables? How will you treat them?
3) Do you see any missing values in any of the 22 variables? How will you treat
them?
C. Questions-Modeling in Python:
Python codes to be shared. Export final results of each question into a word document or
PowerPoint and share along with codes.
4) Develop a logistic regression or Random Forest model to estimate the
relationship between 'class' and the other variables. Suggest variables which are more
important.
Hints:
a. Find correlations, Chi-sq coefficients
b. Check distributions/graphical plots etc.
c. Can distribution/5 point summary help you to find outliers
d. Is there a way to keep the model simple by looking at feature importance/coefficients or looking at
model performances
e. Is your model a overfit or underfit
